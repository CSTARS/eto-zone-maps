## Data Sets

The following datasets are available for use in the determination of the ETo Zone Maps.

* *Spatial CIMIS* - This is a daily set of ETo estimates for California at a 2km grid, starting in 2003.  
* *CalSIMETAW* - This is an estimated daily set of Tn,Tx, and PPT for Californiat at a 4km grid starting in 1921.
* *CIMIS Station Data* - This is a 30 year record of California Weather stations used for calculation of ETo.  Currently, we only have the subset of data from 2003 onwards.
* *NCDC Station Data* - AN 80 record of NCDC weather stations for California.
